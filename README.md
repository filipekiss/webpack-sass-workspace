My default workspace for working with Webpack and Sass (using Node Sass);

You can create a project by running the command below:

```sh
$ yarn create @filipekiss/workspace ~/my-awesome-project
```

If you prefer NPM and have NPM 5.2+:

```sh
$ npx @filipekiss/create-wokspace ~/my-awesome-project
```

If, for some reason, you're stuck in NPM <= 5.1:

```sh
$ npm install -g @filipekiss/create-workspace
$ create-workspace ~/my-awesome-project
```

This is meant for applications where I want to keep the styles apart from the
scripts and so I avoid bundling them using webpack. A simple node-sass will
solve my issue, so that's what I'll use.

Included Batteries:

* [Webpack 4]
* [Sass] via [Node Sass]
* [XO]
* [Prettier] with a default config

I'll keep updating this project as I feel the need to.

## Basic Usage:

Put javascript in `src/scripts` and scss/sass in `src/styles`.

Things will be compiled to the `build` folder.

## Webpack config

* Webpack has an entry point configured to look at `src/scripts/index.js` and output is `dist/[name].[hash].js`
* The [WebpackManifestPlugin] is used to extract a `manifest.json` to the `dist` folder
